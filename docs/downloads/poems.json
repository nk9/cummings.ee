pass)\nwhile hunted from his kingdom winter cowers,\nseeing green armies steadily expand\nhearing the spear-song of the marching grass.\n\nA silver sudden parody of snow\ntickles the air to golden tears,and hark!\nthe flicker’s laughing yet,while on the hills\nthe pines deepen to whispers primeval and throw\nbackward their foreheads to the barbarous bright\nsky,and suddenly from the valley thrills\nthe unimaginable upward lark\nand drowns the earth and passes into light\n\n(slowly in life’s serene perpetual round\na pale world gathers comfort to her soul,\nhope richly scattered by the

head\nstands the clear candle whose expecting breath\nexults upon the tongue of flame half-mute,\n(haste e’er some thrush with silver several tears\ncomplete the perfumed paraphrase of death).\n\nNow is the time when all occasional things\nclose into silence,only one tree,one\nsvelte translation of eternity\nunto the pale meaning of heaven clings,\n(whose million leaves in winsome indolence\nsimmer upon thinking twilight momently)\nas down the oblivious west’s numerous dun\nmagnificence conquers magnificence.\n\nIn heaven’s intolerable athanor\ninimitably tortured the base

stranger thing\nthan crisp Sheba with her king\nin the morning wandering.\n  Through the young and awkward hours\nmy lady perfectly moving,\nthrough the new world scarce astir\nmy fragile lady wandering\nin whose perishable poise\nis the mystery of Spring\n(with her beauty more than snow\ndexterous and fugitive\nmy very frail lady drifting\ndistinctly,moving like a myth\nin the uncertain morning,with\nApril feet like sudden flowers\nand all her body filled with May)\n—moving in the unskilful day\nmy lady utterly alive,\nto me is a more curious thing\n(a thing more nimble and complete)\nthan ever to Judea’s king\nwere the shapely sharp cunning\nand withal delirious feet\nof the Princess Salomé\ncarefully dancing in the noise\nof Herod’s silence,long ago.\n\nIf she a little turn her head\ni know that i am wholly dead:\nnor ever did on such a throat\nthe lips of Tristam slowly dote,\nLa beale Isoud whose leman was.\nAnd if my lady look at me\n(with her eyes which like two elves\nincredibly amuse themselves)\nwith a look of færie,\nperhaps a little suddenly\n(as sometimes the improbably\nbeauty of my lady will)\n—at her glace my spirit shies\nrearing(as in the miracle\nof a lady who had eyes\nwhich the king’s horses might not kill.)\n  But should my lady smile,it were\na flower of so pure surprise\n(it were so very new a flower,\na flower so frail,a flower so glad)\nas trembling used to yield with dew\nwhen the world was young and new\n(a flower such as the world had\nin Springtime when the world was mad\nand Launcelot spoke to Guenever,\na flower which most heavy hung\nwith silence when the world was young\nand Diarmid looked in Grania’s eyes.)\n  But should my lady’s beauty play\nat not speaking(sometimes as\nit will)the silence of her face\ndoth immediately make\nin my heart so great a noise,\nas in the sharp and thirsty blood\nof Paris would not all the Troys\nof Helen’s beauty:never did\nLord Jason(in impossible things\nvictorious impossibly)\nso wholly burn,to undertake\nMedea’s rescuing eyes;nor he\nwhen swooned the white egyptian day\nwho with Egypt’s body lay.\n\nLove as those ladies were\nmine is a little lovelier.\nAnd if she speak in her frail way,\nit is wholly to bewitch\nmy smallest thought with a most swift\nradiance wherein slowly drift\nmurmurous things divinely bright;\nit is foolingly to smite\nmy spirit with the lithe free twitch\nof scintillant space,with the cool writhe\nof gloom truly which syncopate\nsome sunbeam’s skilful fingerings;\nit is utterly to lull\nwith foliate inscrutable\nsweetness my soul obedient;\nit is to stroke my being with\nnumbing forests frolicsome,\nfleetly mystical,aroam\nwith keen creatures of idiom\n(beings alert and innocent\nvery deftly upon which\nindolent miracles impinge)\n—it is distinctly to confute\nmy reason with the deep caress\nof every most shy thing and mute,\nit is to quell me with the twinge\nof all living intense things.\n  Never my soul so fortunate\nis(past the luck of all dead men\nand loving)-as invisibly when\nupon her palpable solitude\na furtive occult fragrance steals,\na gesture of immaculate\nperfume—whereby (with fear aglow)\nmy soul is wont wholly to know\nthe poignant instantaneous fern\nwhose scrupulous enchanted fronds\ntoward all things intrinsic yearn,\nthe immanent subliminal\nfern of her delicious voice\n(of her voice which always dwells\nbesides the vivid magical\nimpetuous and utter ponds\nof dream;and very secret food\nits leaves inimitable find\nbeyond the white authentic springs,\nbeyond the sweet instinctive wells,\nwhich make to flourish the minute\nspontaneous meadow of her mind)\n—the vocal fern,always which feels\nthe keen ecstatic actual tread\n(and thereto perfectly responds)\nof all things exquisite and dead,\nall living things and beautiful.\n(Caliph and king their ladies had\nto love them and to make them glad\nwhen the world was young and mad,\nin the city of Bagdad—\nmine is a little lovelier\nthan any of those ladies were.)\n\nHer body is most beauteous,\nbeing for all things amorous\nfashioned very curiously\nof roses and of ivory.\nThe immaculate crisp head\nis such as only certain dead\nand careful painters love to use\nfor their youngest angels(whose\npraising bodies in a row\nbetween slow glories fleetly go.)\nUpon a keen and lovely throad\nthe strangeness of her face doth float,\nwhich in eyes and lips consists\n—always upon the mouth there trysts\ncurvingly a fragile smile\nwhich like a flower lieth(while\nwithing the eyes is dimly hear\na wistful and precarious bird.)\nSpringing from fragrant shoulders small,\nardent,and perfectly withal\nsmooth to stroke and sweet to see\nas a supple and young tree,\nher slim lascivious arms alight\nin skilful wrists which hint at flight\n—my lady’s very singular\nand slenderest hands moreover are\n(which as lilies smile and quail)\nof all things perfect the most frail.\n\n(Whose rideth in the tale\nof Chaucer knoweth many a pair\nof companions blithe and fair;\nwho to walk with Master Gower\nin Confessio doth prefer\nshall not lack for beauty there,\nnor he that will amaying go\nwith my log Boccaccio—\nwhose knocketh at the door\nof Marie and of Maleore\nfindeth of ladies goodly store\nwhose beauty did in nothing err.\nIf to me there shall appear\nthan a rose more sweetly known,\nmore silently than a flower,\nmy lady naked in her hair—\ni for those ladies nothing care\nnor any lady dead and gone.)\n\nEach tapering breast is firm and smooth\nthan in a lovely fashion doth\nfrom my lady’s body grow;\nas morning may a lily known,\nher petaled flesh doth entertain\nthe adriot blood’s mysterious skein\n(but like some passionate earlier\nflower, the snow will oft utter,\nwhereof the year has perfect bliss—\nfor each breast a blossom is,\nwhich being a little while caressed\nits fragrance makes the lover blest.)\nHer waist is a most tiny hinge\nof flesh,a winsome thing and strange;\napt in my hand warmly to lie\nit is a throbbing neck whereby\nto grasp the belly’s ample vase\n(that urgent urn which doth amass\nfor whoso drinks,a dizzier wine\nthan should the grapes of heaven combine\nwith earth’s madness)—’tis a gate\nunto a palace intricate\n(whereof the luscious pillars rise\nwhich are her lage and shapely thighs)\nin whose dome the trembling bliss\nof a kingdom wholly is.\n  Beneath her thighs such legs are seen\nas were the pride of the world’s queen:\neach is a verb,miraculous\ninflected oral devious,\nbeneath the body’s breathing noun\n(moreover the delicious frown\nof the grave great sensual knees\nwell might any monarch please.)\nEach ankle is divinely shy;\nas if for fear you would espy\nthe little distinct food(if whose\nvery minuteness doth abuse\nreason,why then the artificer\ndid most exquistiely err.)\n\nWhen the world was like a song\nheard behind a golden door,\npoet and sage and caliph had\nto love them and to make them glad\nladies with lithe eyes and long\n(when the world was like a flower\nOmar Hafiz and Harun\nloved their ladies in the moon)\n—fashioned very curiously\nof roses and of ivory\nif naked she appear to me\nmy flesh is an enchanted tree;\nwith her lips’ most frail parting\nmy body hears the cry of Spring,\nand with their frailest syllable\nits leaves go crisp with miracle.\n\nLove!—maker of my lady,\nin that alway beyond this\npoem or any poem she\nof whose body words are afraid\nperfectly beautiful is.\nforgive these words which i have made.\nAnd never boast your dead beauties,\nyou greatest lovers in the world!\nwho with Grania strangely fled,\nwho with Egypt went to bed,\nwhom white-thighed Semiramis\nput up her mouth to wholly kiss—\nnever boast your dead beauties,\nmine being unto me sweeter\n(of whose shy delicious glance\nthings which never more shall be,\nperfect things of færie,\nare intense inhabitants;\nin whose warm superlative\nbody do distinctly live\nall sweet cities passed away—\nin her flesh at break of day\nare the smells of Nineveh,\nin her eyes when day is gone\nare the cries of Babylon.)\nDiarmuid Paris and Solomon,\nOmar Harun and Master Hafiz,\nto me your ladies are all one—\nkeep your dead beautiful ladies.\n\nEater of all things lovely—Time!\nupon whose watering lips the world\npoises a moment(futile,proud,\na costly morsel of sweet tears)\ngesticulates,and disappears—\nof all dainties which do crowd\ngaily upon oblivion\nsweeter than any there is one;\nto touch it is the fear of rhyme—\nin life’s very fragile hour\n(when the world was like a tale\nmade of laughter and of dew,\nwas a flight,a flower,a flame,\nwas a tendril fleety curled\nupon frailness)used to stroll\n(very slowly)one or two\nladies like flowers made,\nsoftly used to wholly move\nslender ladies made of dream\n(in the lazy world and new\nsweetly used to laugh and love\nladies with crisp eyes and frail,\nin the city of
