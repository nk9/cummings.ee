A sharp blue day\nfills with peacefully leaping air\nthe minute mind of the world.\nThe lean and\n\ndefinite houses are\ntroubled.in the sunset their chimneys converse\nangrily,their\nroofs are nervous with the soft furious\nlight,and while fire-escapes and\nroofs and chimneys and while roofs and fire-escapes and\nchimneys and while chimneys and fire-escapes\nand roofs are talking rapidly all together there happens\nSomething,and They\n\ncease(and\none by one are turned suddenly and softly\ninto irresponsible toys.)\n                         when this man with\n\nthe brittle legs winces\nswiftly out of number 1 someThing\nstreet and trickles carefully into the park\nsits\n\nDown.   pigeons circle\naround and around and around the\n\nirresponsible toys\ncircle wildly in the slow-ly-in creasing fragility\n—.Dogs\nbark\nchildren\nplay\n-ing\n     Are\n\nin the beautiful nonsense of twilight\n\nand somebody Napoleon",
