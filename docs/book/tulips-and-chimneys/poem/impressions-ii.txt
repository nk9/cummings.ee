Impressions II

write and
gape of tortured

 perspective
 rasp and graze of splintered

normality
          crackle and
          sag
 of planes     clamors of
 collision
 collapse     As

peacefully,
lifted
into the awful beauty
                      of sunset

                      the young city
putting off dimension with a blush
enters
the becoming garden of her agony
