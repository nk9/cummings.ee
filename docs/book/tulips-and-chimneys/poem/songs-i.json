  "text": "(thee will i praise between those rivers whose\nwhite voices pass upon forgetting(fail\nme not)whose courseless waters are a gloat\nof silver;o’er whose night three willows wail,\na slender dimness in the unshapeful hour\nmaking dear moan in tones of stroked flower;\nlet not thy lust one threaded moment lose:\nhaste)the very shadowy sheep float\nfree upon terrific pastures pale,\n\nwhose tall mysterious shepherd lifts a cheek\nteartroubled to the momentary wind\nwith guiding smile,lips wisely minced for blown\nkisses,condemnatory fingers thinned\nof pity—so he stands counting the moved\nmyriads wonderfully loved,\n(hasten, it is the moment which shall seek\nall blossoms that do learn,scents of not known\nmusics in whose careful eyes are dinned;\n\nand the people of the perfect darkness fills\nhis mind who will their hungering whispers hear\nwith weepings soundless,saying of “alas\nwe were chaste on earth we ghosts:hark to the sheer\ncadence of our gray flesh in the gloom!\nand still to be immortal is our doom;\nbut a rain frailly raging whom the hills\nsink into and their sunsets,it shall pass.\nOur feet tread sleepless meadows sweet with fear”)\n\nthen be with me:unseriously seem\nby the perusing greenness of thy thought\nmy golden soul fabulously to glue\nin a superior terror;be thy taut\nflesh silver,like the currency of faint\ncities eternal—ere the sinless taint\nof thy long sinful arms about me dream\nshall my love wholly taste thee as a new\nwine from steep hills by darkness softly brought—\n\n(be with me in the sacred witchery\nof almostness which May makes follow soon\non the sweet heels of passed afterday,\nclothe thy soul’s coming merely,with a croon\nof mingling robes musically revealed\nin rareness:let thy twain eyes deeply wield\na noise of petals falling silently\nthrough the far-spaced possible nearaway\nfrom huge trees drenched by a rounding moon)",
