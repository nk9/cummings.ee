    <span class="line">Thou aged unreluctant earth who dost</span><br>
    <span class="line">with quivering continual thighs invite</span><br>
    <span class="line">the thrilling rain the slender paramour</span><br>
    <span class="line">to toy with they extraordinary lust,</span><br>
    <span class="line">(the sinuous rain which rising from thy bed</span><br>
    <span class="line">steals to his wife the sky and hour by hour</span><br>
    <span class="line">wholly renews her pale flesh with delight)</span><br>
    <span class="line">—immortally whence are the high gods fled?</span><br>
        </p>
    <p class="stanza">
    <span class="line">Speak elm eloquent pandar with thy nod</span><br>
    <span class="line">significant to the ecstatic earth</span><br>
    <span class="line">in token of his coming whom her soul</span><br>
    <span class="line">burns to embrace—and didst thou know the god</span><br>
    <span class="line">from but the imprint of whose cloven feet</span><br>
    <span class="line">the shrieking dryad sought her leafy goal,</span><br>
    <span class="line">at the mere echo of whose shining mirth</span><br>
    <span class="line">the furious hearts of mountains ceased to beat?</span><br>
        </p>
    <p class="stanza">
    <span class="line">Wind beautifully who wanderest</span><br>
    <span class="line">over smooth pages of forgotten joy</span><br>
    <span class="line">proving the peaceful theorems of the flowers</span><br>
    <span class="line">—didst e'er depart upon more exquisite quest?</span><br>
    <span class="line">and did they fortunate fingers sometime dwell</span><br>
    <span class="line">(within a greener shadow of secret bowers)</span><br>
    <span class="line">amoung the curves of that delicious boy</span><br>
    <span class="line">whose serious grace one goddes loved too well?</span><br>
        </p>
    <p class="stanza">
    <span class="line">Chryselephantine Zeus Olympian</span><br>
    <span class="line">sceptred colossus of the Pheidian soul</span><br>
    <span class="line">whose eagle frights creation, in whose palm</span><br>
    <span class="line">Nike presents the crown sweetest to man,</span><br>
    <span class="line">whose lilied robe the sun’s white hands emboss,</span><br>
    <span class="line">betwixt whose absolute feet anoint with calm</span><br>
    <span class="line">of intent stars circling the acerb pole</span><br>
    <span class="line">poises, smiling, the diadumenos</span><br>
        </p>
    <p class="stanza">
    <span class="line">in whose young chiseled eyes the people saw</span><br>
    <span class="line">their once again victorious Pantarkes</span><br>
    <span class="line">(whose grace the prince of artists made him bold</span><br>
    <span class="line">to imitate between the feet of aw),</span><br>
    <span class="line">thunderer whose omnipotent brow showers</span><br>
    <span class="line">its curls of unendured eternal gold</span><br>
    <span class="line">over the infinite breast in bright degrees,</span><br>
    <span class="line">whose pillow is the graces and the hours,</span><br>
        </p>
    <p class="stanza">
    <span class="line">father of gods and men whose subtle throne</span><br>
    <span class="line">twain sphinxes bear each with a writhing youth</span><br>
    <span class="line">caught to her brazen breasts, whose foot-stool tells</span><br>
    <span class="line">how fought the looser of the warlike zone</span><br>
    <span class="line">of her that brought forth tall Hippolytus,</span><br>
    <span class="line">lord on whose pedestal the deep expels</span><br>
    <span class="line">(over Selene’s car closing uncouth)</span><br>
    <span class="line">of Helios the sweet wheels tremulous—</span><br>
        </p>
    <p class="stanza">
    <span class="line">are there no kings in Argos, that the song</span><br>
    <span class="line">is silent, of the steep unspeaking tower</span><br>
    <span class="line">within whose brightening strictness Danæ</span><br>
    <span class="line">saw the night severed and the glowing throng</span><br>
    <span class="line">descend, felt on her flesh the amorous strain</span><br>
    <span class="line">of gradual hands and yielding to that fee</span><br>
    <span class="line">her eager body's unimmortal flower</span><br>
    <span class="line">knew in the darkness a more burning rain?</span><br>
        </p>
    <p class="stanza">
    <span class="line">2.</span><br>
        </p>
    <p class="stanza">
    <span class="line">And still the mad magnificent herald Spring</span><br>
    <span class="line">assembles beauty from forgetfulness</span><br>
    <span class="line">with the wild trump of April: witchery</span><br>
    <span class="line">of sound and odour drives the wingless thing</span><br>
    <span class="line">man forth into bright air, for now the red</span><br>
    <span class="line">leaps in the maple’s cheek, and suddenly</span><br>
    <span class="line">by shining hordes in sweet unserious dress</span><br>
    <span class="line">ascends the golden crocus from the dead.</span><br>
        </p>
    <p class="stanza">
    <span class="line">On dappled dawn forth rides the pungent sun</span><br>
    <span class="line">with hooded day preening upon his hand</span><br>
    <span class="line">followed by gay untimid final flowers</span><br>
    <span class="line">(which dressed in various tremulous armor stun</span><br>
    <span class="line">the eyes of the ragged earth who sees them pass)</span><br>
    <span class="line">while hunted from his kingdom winter cowers,</span><br>
    <span class="line">seeing green armies steadily expand</span><br>
    <span class="line">hearing the spear-song of the marching grass.</span><br>
        </p>
    <p class="stanza">
    <span class="line">A silver sudden parody of snow</span><br>
    <span class="line">tickles the air to golden tears, and hark!</span><br>
    <span class="line">the flicker’s laughing yet, while on the hills</span><br>
    <span class="line">the pines deepen to whispers primeval and throw</span><br>
    <span class="line">backward their foreheads to the barbarous bright</span><br>
    <span class="line">sky, and suddenly from the valley thrills</span><br>
    <span class="line">the unimaginable upward lark</span><br>
    <span class="line">and drowns the earth and passes into light</span><br>
        </p>
    <p class="stanza">
    <span class="line">(slowly in life’s serene perpetual round</span><br>
    <span class="line">a pale world gathers comfort to her soul,</span><br>
    <span class="line">hope richly scattered by the abundant sun</span><br>
    <span class="line">invades the new mosaic of the ground</span><br>
    <span class="line">—let but the incurious curtaining dusk be drawn</span><br>
    <span class="line">surpassing nets are sedulously spun</span><br>
    <span class="line">to snare the brutal dew,—the authentic scroll</span><br>
    <span class="line">of fairie hands and vanishing of the dawn).</span><br>
        </p>
    <p class="stanza">
    <span class="line">Spring, that omits no mention of desire</span><br>
    <span class="line">in every curved and curling thing, yet holds</span><br>
    <span class="line">continous intercourse—through skies and trees</span><br>
    <span class="line">the lilac’s smoke the poppy’s pompous fire</span><br>
    <span class="line">the pansy’s purple patience and the grave</span><br>
    <span class="line">frailty of daisies—by what rare unease</span><br>
    <span class="line">revealed of teasingly transparent folds—</span><br>
    <span class="line">with man’s poor soul superlatively brave.</span><br>
        </p>
    <p class="stanza">
    <span class="line">Surely from robes of particoloured peace</span><br>
    <span class="line">with mouth flower-faint and undiscovered eyes</span><br>
    <span class="line">and dim slow perfect body amorous</span><br>
    <span class="line">(whiter than lilies which are born and cease</span><br>
    <span class="line">for being whiter than this world) exhales</span><br>
    <span class="line">the hovering high perfume curious</span><br>
    <span class="line">of that one month for whom the whole year dies,</span><br>
    <span class="line">risen at length from palpitating veils.</span><br>
        </p>
    <p class="stanza">
    <span class="line">O still miraculous May! O shining girl</span><br>
    <span class="line">of time untarnished! O small intimate</span><br>
    <span class="line">gently primeval hands, frivolous feet</span><br>
    <span class="line">divine! O singular and breathless pearl!</span><br>
    <span class="line">O indefinable frail ultimate pose!</span><br>
    <span class="line">O visible beatitude sweet sweet</span><br>
    <span class="line">intolerable! silence immaculate</span><br>
    <span class="line">of god’s evasive audible great rose!</span><br>
        </p>
    <p class="stanza">
    <span class="line">3.</span><br>
        </p>
    <p class="stanza">
    <span class="line">Lover, lead forth they love unto that bed</span><br>
    <span class="line">prepared by whitest hands of waiting years,</span><br>
    <span class="line">curtained with wordless worship absolute,</span><br>
    <span class="line">unto the certain altar at whose head</span><br>
    <span class="line">stands the clear candle whose expecting breath</span><br>
    <span class="line">exults upon the tongue of flame half-mute,</span><br>
    <span class="line">(haste e’er some thrush with silver several tears</span><br>
    <span class="line">complete the perfumed paraphrase of death).</span><br>
        </p>
    <p class="stanza">
    <span class="line">Now is the time when all occassional things</span><br>
    <span class="line">close into silence, only one tree, one</span><br>
    <span class="line">svelte translation of eternity</span><br>
    <span class="line">unto the pale meaning of heaven clings,</span><br>
    <span class="line">(whose million leaves in winsome indolence</span><br>
    <span class="line">simmer upon thinking twilight momently)</span><br>
    <span class="line">as down the oblivious west’s numerous dun</span><br>
    <span class="line">magnificence conquers magnificence.</span><br>
        </p>
    <p class="stanza">
    <span class="line">In heaven’s intolerable athanor</span><br>
    <span class="line">inimitably tortured the base day</span><br>
    <span class="line">utters at length her soft intrinsic hour,</span><br>
    <span class="line">and from those tenuous fires which more and more</span><br>
    <span class="line">sink and are lost the divine alchemist,</span><br>
    <span class="line">the magus of creation, lifts a flower—</span><br>
    <span class="line">whence is the world’s insufferable clay</span><br>
    <span class="line">clothed with incognizable amethyst.</span><br>
        </p>
    <p class="stanza">
    <span class="line">Lady at whose imperishable smile</span><br>
    <span class="line">the amazed doves flicker upon sunny wings</span><br>
    <span class="line">as if in terror of eternity,</span><br>
    <span class="line">(or seeming that they would msitrust a while</span><br>
    <span class="line">the moving of beauteous dead mouths throughout</span><br>
    <span class="line">that very proud transparent company</span><br>
    <span class="line">of quivering ghosts-of-love which scarcely sings</span><br>
    <span class="line">drifting in slow diaphanous faint rout),</span><br>
        </p>
    <p class="stanza">
    <span class="line">queen in the inconceivable embrace</span><br>
    <span class="line">of whose tremendous hair that blossom stands</span><br>
    <span class="line">whereof is most desire, yet less than those</span><br>
    <span class="line">twain perfect roses whose ambrosial grace,</span><br>
    <span class="line">goddess, they crippled thunder-forging groom</span><br>
    <span class="line">of the loud lord of skipping mænads knows,—</span><br>
    <span class="line">having Discordia’s apple in thy hands,</span><br>
    <span class="line">which the scared shepherd gave thee for his doom—</span><br>
        </p>
    <p class="stanza">
    <span class="line">O thou within the chancel of whose charms</span><br>
    <span class="line">the tall boy god of everlasting war</span><br>
    <span class="line">received the shuddering sacrament of sleep,</span><br>
    <span class="line">betwixt whose cool incorrigible arms</span><br>
    <span class="line">impaled upon delicious mystery,</span><br>
    <span class="line">with gaunt limbs reeking of the whispered deep,</span><br>
    <span class="line">deliberate groping ocean fondled o’er</span><br>
    <span class="line">the warm long flower of unchastity,</span><br>
        </p>
    <p class="stanza">
    <span class="line">imperial Cytherea, from frail foam</span><br>
    <span class="line">sprung with irrevocable nakedness</span><br>
    <span class="line">to strike the young world into smoking song—</span><br>
    <span class="line">as the first star perfects the sensual dome</span><br>
    <span class="line">of darkness, and the sweet strong final bird</span><br>
    <span class="line">transcends the sight, O thou to whom belong</span><br>
    <span class="line">the hearts of lovers!—I beseech thee bless</span><br>
    <span class="line">thy suppliant singer and his wandering word.</span><br>
