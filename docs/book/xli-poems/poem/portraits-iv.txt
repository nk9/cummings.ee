Portraits IV

the skinny voice

of the leatherfaced
woman with the crimson
nose and coquettishly-
cocked bonnet

having ceased     the

captain
announces that as three
dimes seven nickels and ten
pennies have been deposited upon

the drum   there is need

of just twenty five cents
dear friends
to make it an even
dollar      whereupon

the Divine Average who was

attracted by the inspired
sisterâ€™s howling moves
off
will anyone tell him why he should

blow two bits for the coming of Christ Jesus

?

???
!

nix, kid
