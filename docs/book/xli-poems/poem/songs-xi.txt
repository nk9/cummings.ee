Songs XI

i will wade out
               till my thighs are steeped in burning flowers
I will take the sun in my mouth
and leap into the ripe air
                           Alive
                                 with closed eyes
to dash against darkness
                       in the sleeping curves of my body
Shall enter fingers of smooth mastery
with chasteness of sea-girls
                             Will i complete the mystery
                             of my flesh
I will rise
            After a thousand years
lipping
flowers
        And set my teeth in the silver of the moon
