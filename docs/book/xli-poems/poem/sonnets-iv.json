  "text": "this is the garden:colours come and go,\nfrail azures fluttering from night’s outer wing\nstrong silent greens serenely lingering,\nabsolute lights like baths of golden snow. \nThis is the garden:pursed lips do blow\nupon cool flutes within wide glooms,and sing\n(of harps celestial to the quivering string)\ninvisible faces hauntingly and slow.\n\nThis is the garden.   Time shall surely reap\nand on Death’s blade lie many a flower curled,\nin other lands where other songs be sung;\nyet stand They here enraptured,as among\nthe slow deep trees perpetual of sleep\nsome silver-fingered fountain steals the world.",
