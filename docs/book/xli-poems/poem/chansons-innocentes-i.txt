Chansons Innocentes I

why did you go
little fourpaws?
you forgot to shut
your big eyes

where did you go?
like little kittens
are all the leaves
which open in the rain.

little kittens who
are called spring,
is what we stroke
maybe asleep?

do you know?or maybe did
something go away
every so quietly
when we werenâ€™t looking.
