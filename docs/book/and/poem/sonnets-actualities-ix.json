By midnight,\n                            a moon\nscratches the skin of the organised hills\n\nan edged nothing begins to prune\n\nlet’s live like the light that kills\nand let’s as silence,\n                     because Whirl’s after all:\n(after me)love,and after you\nI occasionally feel vague how\nvague i don’t know tenuous Now-\nspears and The Then-arrows making do\nour mouths something red,something tall",
