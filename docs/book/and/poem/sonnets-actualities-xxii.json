My crazy fingers liked your dress\n....your kiss,your kiss was a distinct brittle\n\nflower,and the flesh crisp set\nmy love-tooth on edge.   So until light\neach having each we promised to forget—\n\nwherefore is there nothing left to guess:\nthe cheap intelligent thighs,the electric trite\nthighs;the hair stupidly priceless.",
