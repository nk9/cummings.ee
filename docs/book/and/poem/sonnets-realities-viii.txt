Sonnetsâ€”Realities VIII

her careful distinct sex whose sharp lips comb

my mumbling gropeofstrength(staggered by the lug
of love)
        sincerely greets,with an occult shrug
asking Through her Muteness will slowly roam
my dumbNess?

             her other,wet,warm

lips limp,across my brusing smile;
as rapidly upon the jiggled norm

of agony my grunting eyes pin tailored flames
Her being at this instant commits

as impenetrable transparency.
the harsh erecting breasts and uttering tits
punish my hug
              presto!

                      the bright rile
of jovial hair extremely frames

the face in a hoop of grim ecstasy
