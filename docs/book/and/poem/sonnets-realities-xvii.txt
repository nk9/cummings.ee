Sonnets—Realities XVII

whereas by dark really released,the modern
flame of her indomitable body
uses a careful fierceness.   Her lips study
my head gripping for a decision:burn
the terrific fingers which grapple and joke
on my passionate anatomy
of yes!   Large legs pinch,toes choke—
hair-thin strands of magic agony
....by day this lady in her limousine

oozes in fashionable traffic,just
a halfsmile (for society’s sweet sake)
in the not too frail lips almost discussed;
between her and ourselves a nearly-opaque
perfume disinterestedly obscene.
