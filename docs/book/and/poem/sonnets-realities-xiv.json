More\ninteresting,as i think,her charms\nen repos....a fattish leg leaks\nobscenely from the dress.   one nipple tries.\nplayfully to peek into the belly\nwhose deep squirm nibbles.  another couches,\nweary,upon a flabby mattress of jelly....\nthan when to the kanoon she totters,slouches,\nwith giggling hips and frozen eyes",
