It is so quite new a thing.\nMuscles better and nerves more.\ni like your body.   i like what it does,\ni like its hows.   i like to feel the spine\nof your body and its bones,and the trembling\n-firm-smooth ness and which i will\nagain and again and again\nkiss,   i like kissing this and that of you,\ni like,slowly stroking the,shocking fuzz\nof your electric fur,and what-is-it comes\nover parting flesh....And eyes big love-crumbs,\n\nand possibly i like the thrill\n\nof under me you so quite new",
