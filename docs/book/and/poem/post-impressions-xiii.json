  "text": "the dress was a suspicious madder,importing the cruelty of roses.\nThe exciting simplicity of her hipless body,pausing to invent im-\nperceptible bulgings of the pretended breasts,forked in surpris-\nable unliving eyes chopped by a swollen inanity of picture hat.\n   the arms hung ugly., the hands sharp and impertinently dead.\n   expression began with the early cessation of her skirt.   flesh-\nless melody of the,keenly lascivious legs.   painful ankles large\nacute brutal feet propped on irrelevantly ferocious heels.\n   Her gasping slippery body moved with the hideous spontaneity\nof a solemn mechanism.   beneath her drab tempo of hasteful futility\nlived brilliantly the enormous rhythm of absurdity.\n   skin like the poisonous fragility of ice newly formed upon an old\npool.   Her nose was small,exact,stupid.   mouth normal,large,unclever.\nhair genuinely artificial,unpleasantly tremendous.\n   under flat lusts of light her nice concupiscence appeared rounded.\n   if she were alive,death was amusing",
