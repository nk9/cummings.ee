The horses sleep upstairs.\nAnd you can see their ears.   Ears win-\n\nk,funny stable.   In the morning they go out in pairs:\namazingly,one pair is white\n(but you know that)they look at each other.   Nudge.\n\n(if they love each other,who cares?)\nThey pull the morning out of the night.\n\nI am living with a mouse who shares\n\nmy meals with him,which is fair as i judge.",
