 now that fierce few
 flowers(stealthily)
 in the alive west
 begin

 requiescat this six
 feet of Breton big good
 body, which terminated
 in fists hair wood

 erect cursing hatless who
 (bent by wind)slammed hard-
 over the tiller;clattered
 forward skidding in outrageous

 sabots language trickling
 pried his black
 mouth with fat jibing
 lips,

 once upon a
 (that is
 over: and the sea heaving
 indolent colourless forgets)time

 Requiescat.
 carry
 carefully the blessed large silent him
 into nibbling final worms
