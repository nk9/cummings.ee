 the moon looked into my window
 it touched me with its small hands
 and with curling infantile
 fingers it understood my eyes cheeks mouth
 its hands(slipping)felt of my necktie wandered
 against my shirt and into my body the
 sharp things fingered tinily my heart life

 the little hands withdrew, jerkily, themselves
 quietly they began playing with a button
 the moon smiled she
 let go my vest and crept
 through the window
 she did not fall
 she went creeping along the air
                                over houses
                                           roofs

 And out of the east toward
 her a fragile light bent gatheringly
