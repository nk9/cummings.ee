 her careful distinct sex whose sharp lips comb

 my mumbling gropeofstrength(staggered by the lug
 of love)
         sincerely greets,with an occult shrug
 asking Through her Muteness will slowly roam
 my dumbNess?

              her other,wet,warm

 lips limp,across my brusing smile;
 as rapidly upon the jiggled norm

 of agony my grunting eyes pin tailored flames
 Her being at this instant commits

 as impenetrable transparency.
 the harsh erecting breasts and uttering tits
 punish my hug
               presto!

                       the bright rile
 of jovial hair extremely frames

 the face in a hoop of grim ecstasy
