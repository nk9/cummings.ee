 she sits dropping on a caret of clenched arms
 a delicately elephantine face
 (It is necessary to find Hassan’s Place
 by tiny streets shrugging with colour)
 the mouth who sits between her cheeks
 utters a thud of scarlet.  always.   More
 interesting,as i think,her charms
 en repos....a fattish leg leaks
 obscenely from the dress.   one nipple tries.
 playfully to peek into the belly
 whose deep squirm nibbles.  another couches,
 weary,upon a flabby mattress of jelly....
 than when to the kanoon she totters,slouches,
 with giggling hips and frozen eyes
