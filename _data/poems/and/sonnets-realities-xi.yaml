 god pity me whom(god distinctly has)
 the weightless svelte drifting sexual feather
 of your shall i say body?follows
 truly through a dribbling moan of jazz

 whose arched occasional steep youth swallows
 curvingly the keenness of my hips;
 or,your first twitch of crisp boy flesh dips
 my height in a firm fragile stinging weather,

 (breathless with sharp necessary lips)kid

 female cracksman of the nifty,ruffian-rogue,
 laughing body with wise breasts half-grown,
 lisping flesh quick to thread the fattish drone
 of I Want a Doll,
                   wispish-agile feet with slid
 steps parting the tousle of saxophonic brogue.
