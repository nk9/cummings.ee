 life boosts herself rapidly at me

 through sagging debris of exploded day
 the hulking perpendicular mammal
                                  a
 grim epitome of chuckling flesh.
 Weak thirsty fists of idiot futures bash

 the bragging breasts,
                      puppy-faces to mouth
 her ugly nipples squirming in pretty wrath,
 gums skidding on slippery udders

                                  she
 lifts an impertinent puerperal face
 and with astute fatuous swallowed eyes
 smiles,
         one grin very distinctly wobbles
 from the thinning lips me hugely which embrace.
 as in the hairy notching of clenched thighs

 a friendless dingy female frenzy bubbles
