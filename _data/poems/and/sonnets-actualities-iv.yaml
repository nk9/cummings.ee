 utterly and amusingly i am pash
 possibly because
                 .dusk and if it
 perhaps drea-mingly Is(not-
 quite trees hugging with the rash,
 coherant light
               )only to trace with
 stiffening slow shrill eyes beyond a fit-
 and-cling of stuffs the alert willing myth
 of body,which will make oddly to strut
 my indolent priceless smile,
                             until
 this very frail enormous star(do you see
 it?)and this shall dance upon the nude
 and final silence and shall the
 (i do but touch you)timid lewd
 moon plunge skilfully into the hill.
