 O Thou to whom the musical white spring

 offers her lily inextinguishable,
 taught by thy tremulous grace bravely to fling

 Implacable death’s mysteriously sable
 robe from her redolent shoulders,
                                  Thou from whose
 feet reincarnate song suddenly leaping
 flameflung,mounts,inimitably to lose
 herself where the wet stars softly are keeping

 their exquisite dreams—O Love! upon thy dim
 shrine of intangible commemoration,
 (from whose faint close as some grave languorous hymn
 
 pledged to illimitable dissipation
 unhurried clouds of incense fleetly roll)

 i spill my bright incalculable soul.
