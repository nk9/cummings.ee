 earth like a tipsy
 biddy with an old mop punching
 underneath
 conventions exposes

 hidden obscenities
 nudging
 into neglected sentiments brings
 to light dusty

 heroisms
 and
 finally colliding with the most 
 expensive furniture upsets

 a
 crucifix which smashes into several
 pieces and is hurriedly picked up and 
 thrown on the ash-heap

 where
 lies
        what was once the discobolus of
 one
 
 Myron
