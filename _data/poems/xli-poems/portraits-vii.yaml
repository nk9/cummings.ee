first_line: my mind is

text: |-1
 my mind is
 a big hunk of irrevocable nothing which touch and taste and smell
 and hearing and sight keep hitting and chipping with sharp fatal
 tools
 in an agony of sensual chisels i perform squirms of chrome and ex-
 ecute strides of cobalt
 nevertheless i
 feel that i cleverly am being altered that i slightly am becoming
 something a little different,in fact
 myself
 Hereupon helpless i utter lilac shrieks and scarlet bellowings.
