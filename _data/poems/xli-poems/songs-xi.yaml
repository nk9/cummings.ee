 i will wade out
                till my thighs are steeped in burning flowers
 I will take the sun in my mouth
 and leap into the ripe air
                            Alive
                                  with closed eyes
 to dash against darkness
                        in the sleeping curves of my body
 Shall enter fingers of smooth mastery
 with chasteness of sea-girls
                              Will i complete the mystery
                              of my flesh
 I will rise
             After a thousand years
 lipping
 flowers
         And set my teeth in the silver of the moon
