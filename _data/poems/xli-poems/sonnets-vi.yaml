first_line: when the proficient poison sure sleep

 when the proficient poison sure sleep
 bereaves us of our slow tranquillities

 and He without Whose favour nothing is
 (being of men called Love) upward doth leap
 from the mute hugeness of depriving deep,

 with thunder of those hungering wings of His,

 into the lucent and large signories
 â€”i shall not smile beloved;i shall not weep:

 when from the less-then-whiteness of thy face
 (whose eyes inherit vacancy) will time
 extract his inconsiderable doom,
 when these they lips beautifully embrace
 nothing
         and when thy bashful hands assume

 silence beyond the mystery of rhyme
