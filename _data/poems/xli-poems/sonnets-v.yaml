 Thou in whose swordgreat story shine the deeds
 of history her heroes,sounds the tread
 of those vast armies of the marching dead,
 with standards and the neighing of great steeds
 moving to war across the smiling meads;
 thou by whose page we break the precious bread
 of dear communion with the past,and wed
 to valor,battle with heroic breeds;

 thou,Froissart,for that thou didst love the pen
 while others wrote in steel,accept all praise
 of after ages,and of hungering days
 for whom the old glories move,the old trumpets cry;
 who gavest as one of those immortal men
 his life that his fair city might not die.
