 when learned darkness from our searched world
 
 wrestest the rare unwisdom of thy eyes,
 if thy two hands flowers of silence curled
 
 upon a thought, to rapture should surprise
 my soul slowly which on thy beauty dreamest
 —proud through the cold perfect night whisperless
 
 to mark, how that asleep whitely thou seemest
 
 (whose lips the whole of life almost do guess)
 
 if god should send the morning; and before
 my doubting window leaves softly to stir,
 of thoughtful trees whom night hath pondered o’er
 —and frailties of dimension to occur
 
 about us
         and birds known, scarcely to sing
 
 (heart, shalt thou bear the marvel of this thing?)
