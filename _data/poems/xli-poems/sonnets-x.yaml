first_line: I have seen her stealthily frail

text: |-1
 I have seen her stealthily frail
 flower walking with its fellows in the death
 of light,against whose enormous curve of flesh
 exactly cubes of tiny fragrance try;
 i have watched certain petals rapidly wish
 in the corners of her youth;whom,fiercely shy
 and gently brutal,the prettiest wrath
 of blossoms dishevelling made a pale
 fracas upon the accurate moon....
 Across the important gardens her body
 will come toward me with its hurting sexual smell
 of lilies....beyond nightâ€™s silken immense swoon
 the moon is like a floating silver hell
 a song of adolescent ivory.
