 you give us Things
 which
 bulge:grunting lungs pumped full of sharp thick mind

 you make us shrill
 presents always
 shut in the sumptuous screech of
 simplicity

 (out of the
 black unbunged
 Something gushes vaguely a squeak of planes
 or

 between squeals of
 Nothing grabbed with circular shrieking tightness
 solid screams whisper.)

 your brainâ€™s
 axe only chops hugest inherent
 Trees of Ego,from
 whose living and biggest

 bodies lopped
 of every
 prettiness

 you hew form truly
