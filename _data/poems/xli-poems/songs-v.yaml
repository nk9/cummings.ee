first_line: Where’s Madge then,

text: |-1
 Where’s Madge then,
 Madge and her men?
 buried with
 Alice in her hair,
 (but if you ask the rain
 he’ll not tell where.)

 beauty makes terms
 with time and his worms,
 when loveliness
 says sweetly Yes
 to wind and cold;
 and how much earth
 is Madge worth?
 Inquire of the flower that sways in the autumn
 she will never guess.
 but i know
