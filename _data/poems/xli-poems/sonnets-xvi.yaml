 by god i want above fourteenth

 fifth’s deep purring biceps,the mystic screetch
 of Broadway,the trivial stink of rich

 frail firm asinine life
                         (i pant

 for what’s below.      the singer.      Wall.      i want
 the perpendicular lips the insane teeth
 the vertical grin

                   give me the Square in spring,
 the little barbarous Greenwich perfumed fake

 And most,the futile fooling labyrinth
 where noisy colors stroll....and the Baboon

 sniggering insipidities while.  i sit,sipping
 singular anisettes as.   One opaque
 big girl jiggles thickly hips to the kanoon

 but Hassan chuckles seeing the Greeks breathe)
