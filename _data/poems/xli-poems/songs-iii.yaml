text: |-1
 when life is quite through with
 and leaves say alas,
 much is to do
 for the swallow,that closes
 a flight in the blue;

 when love ’s had his tears out,
 perhaps shall pass
 a million years
 (while a bee dozes
 on the poppies,the dears;

 when all’s done and said,and
 under the grass
 lies her head
 by oaks and roses
 deliberated.)
