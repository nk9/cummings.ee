text: |-1
 who’s most afraid of death?thou
                                 art of him
 utterly afraid,i love of thee
 (beloved)this

              and truly i would be
 near when his scythe takes crisply the whim
 of thy smoothness. and the mark the fainting
 murdered petals.    with the caving stem.

 But of all most would i be one of them

 round the hurt heart which do so frailly cling....)
 i who am but imperfect in my fear

 Or with thy mind against my mind,to hear
 nearing our hearts’ irrevocable play—
 through the mysterious high futile day

 an enormous stride
                   (and drawing thy mouth toward

 my mouth,steer our lost bodies carefully downward)
