first_line: into the smiting

text: |-1
 into the smiting
 sky tense
 with
 blend

 ing
 the
 tree     leaps
                a stiffened exquisite

 i
 wait the sweet
 annihilation of swift
 flesh

 i make me stern against
 your charming strength


 O haste
         annihilator
 drawing into you my enchanting
 leaves
