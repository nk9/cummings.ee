 at the ferocious phenomenon of 5 o’clock i find myself
 gently decomposing in the mouth of New York. Bet-
 ween its supple financial teeth delirlously sprouting
 from complacent gums,a morsel prettily wanders buoy-
 ed on the murderous saliva of industry. the morsel is i.

 Vast cheeks enclose me.

 a gigantic  uvula  with  imperceptible  gesticulations
 threatens the tubular downward blackness occasionally
 from which detatching itself bumps clumsily into the
 throat A meticulous vulgarity:

 a sodden fastidious normal explosion; a square mur-
 mur, a winsome flatulence—

 In the soft midst of the tongue sits the Woolworth
 building a serene pastile-shaped insipid kinesis of frail
 swooping lozenge.  a ruglike sentience whose papillæ
 expertly drink the docile perpendicular taste of this
 squirming  cube  of  undiminished  silence,  supports
 while devouring the firm tumult of exquisitely in-
 secure sharp algebraic music.  For the first time in
 sorting from this vast nonchalant inward walk of vol-
 ume the flat minute gallop of careful hugeness i am
 conjugated by the sensual mysticism of entire vertical
 being, i am skilfully construed by a delicately experi-
 menting colossus whose irrefutable spiral antics involve
 me with the soothings of plastic hypnotism        . i am
 accurately parsed  by this gorgeous rush  of  upward
 lips....

 perching on the sudden extremity of one immense
 tooth myself surveys safely the complete important
 profane frantic inconsequential gastronomic mystery
 of mysteries

 Far below myself the lunging leer of horizontal large
 distinct ecstasy wags and. rages Laughters jostle grins
 nudge smiles push—.deep into the edgeless gloaming
 gladness hammers incessant putrid spikes of madness
 (at

 Myself’s height these various innocent ferocities are
 superceded by the sole prostituted ferocity of silence,
 it is) still 5 o’clock
 I stare only always into the tremendous canyon the

 ,tremendous canyon always only exhales a climbing
 dark exact walloping human noise of digestible mill-
 ions  whose  rich  slovenly  obscene  procession always
 floats through the thin amorous enormous only lips of
 the evening

      And it is 5 o’clock

      in the oblong air, from which a singular ribbon
 of common sunset is hanging,

 snow speaks slowly
