text: |-1
 conversation with my friend is particularly
 to enjoy the composed sudden body atop which always
 quiverstheelectricDistinct face haughtilyvitalclinched
 in a swoon of synopsis

 despite a sadistic modesty his mind is seen frequently
 fingering the exact beads of a faultless languor when
 invisibly consult with some delicious image the a little
 strolling lips and eyes inwardly crisping

 for my friend, feeling is the sacred and agonizing
 proximity to its desire of a doomed impetuous acute
 sentience whose whitehot lips however suddenly ap-
 proached may never quite taste the wine which their
 nearness evaporates

 to think is the slippery contours of a vase inexpressibly
 fragile it is for the brain irrevocably frigid to touch a
 merest shape which however slenderly by it caressed
 will explode and spill the immediate imperceptible
 content

 my friendâ€™s being, out of the spontaneous clumsy trivi-
 al acrobatic edgeless gesture of existence, continually
 whittles keen careful futile flowers

 (isolating with perpetually meticulous concupiscence
 the bright large undeniable disease of Life, himself
 occasionally contrives an unreal precise intrinsic frag-
 ment of actuality),

 an orchid whose velocity is sculptural
