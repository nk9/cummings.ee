 at the head of this street a gasping organ is waving moth-
 eaten tunes.   a fatish hand turns the crank; the box spouts
 fairies, out of it sour gnomes tumble clumsily, the littel box
 is spilling rancid elves upon neat sunlight into the flower-
 stricken air which is filthy with agile swarming sonal crea-
 tures
 
 —Children, stand with circular frightened faces glaring at
 the shabby tiny smiling, man in whose hand the crank goes
 desperately, round and round pointing to the queer monkey
 
 (if you toss him a coin he will pick it cleverly from, the air
 and stuff it seriously in, his minute pocket) Sometimes he
 does not catch a piece of money and then his master will
 yell at him over the music and jerk the little string and the
 monkey will sit, up, and loo at, you with his solemn blinky
 eyeswhichneversmile and after he has caught a, penny or
 three, pennies he will be thrown a peanut (which he will
 open skilfully with his, mouth carefully holding, it in his
 little toylikehand) and then he will stiff-ly throw the shell
 away with a small bored gesture that makes the children
 laugh.
 
 But i don’t,   the crank goes round desperate elves and hope-
 less gnomes and frantic fairies gush clumsily from the
 battered box fatish and mysterious the flowerstricken sun-
 light is thickening dizzily is reeling gently the street and
 the children and the monkeyandtheorgan and the man are
 dancing slowly are tottering up and down in trembly mist
 of atrocious melody .... tiniest dead tunes crawl upon my
 face my hair is lousy with mutilated singing microscopic
 things in my ears scramble faintly tickling putrescent
 atomies,
         and
             i feel the jerk of the little string! the tiny
 smiling shabby man is yelling over the music i understand
 him i shove my round red hat back on my head i site up and
 blink at you with my solemn eyeswhichneversmile
 
 yes, By god.
 for i am they are pointing at the queer monkey with a little
 oldish doll-like face and hairy arms like an ogre and rub-
 bbercoloured hands and feet filled with quick fingers and a
 remarkable tail which is allbyitself alive. (and he has a
 little red coat with i have a real pocket in it and the round
 funny hat with a big feather is tied under myhis chin.)
 that climbs and cries and runs and floats like a toy on the
 end of a string
