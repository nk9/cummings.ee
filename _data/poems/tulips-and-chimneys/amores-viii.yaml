 your little voice
                   Over the wires came leaping
 and i felt suddenly
 dizzy
       With the jostling and shouting of merry flowers
 wee skipping high-heeled flames
 courtesied before my eyes
                           or twinkling over to my side
 Looked up
 with impertinently exquisite faces
 floating hands were laid upon me
 I was whirled and tossed into delicious dancing
 up
 Up
 with the pale important
                        stars and the Humorous
                                               moon
 dear girl
 How i was crazy how i cried when i heard
                                          over time
 and tide and death
 leaping
 Sweetly
         your voice
