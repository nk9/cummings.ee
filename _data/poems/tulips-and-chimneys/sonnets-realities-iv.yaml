 when you rang at Dick Mid’s Place
 the madam was a bulb stuck in the door.
 a fang of wincing gas showed how
 hair,in two fists of shrill colour,
 clutched the dull volume of her tumbling face
 scribbled with a big grin.   her sow-
 eyes clicking mischief from thick lids.
 the chunklike nose on which always the four
 tablets of perspiration erectly sitting.
 —If they knew you at Dick Mid’s
 the three trickling chins began to traipse
 into the cheeks “eet smeestaire steevensun
 kum een, dare ease Bet,an Leelee,an dee beeg wun”
 her handless wrists did gooey severe shapes.
