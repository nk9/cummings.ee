 in Just-
 spring     when the world is mud-
 luscious the little
 lame baloonman

 whistles    far    and wee

 and eddieandbill come
 running from marbles and
 piracies and it’s
 spring

 when the world is puddle-wonderful

 the queer
 old baloonman whistles
 far    and    wee
 and bettyandisbel come dancing

 from hop-scotch and jump-rope and

 it’s
 spring
 and

    the

          goat-footed

 baloonMan    whistles
 far
 and
 wee
